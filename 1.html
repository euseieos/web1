Hello, it's me<br>
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
<p>To go over everything</p>
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
<p style="margin-top:45px"></p>Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
<pre>When we were younger and free</pre>
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles<hr>
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
<p>Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Hello from the other side</p><p>
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
